# Word-Count
A program written made in CS 314 - Principles of Programming Languages

This program takes subdirectories in the same folder and counts the number of occurences of each word. Then, it creates a discrete distribution of the counts and creates a graph with MatPlotLib of the number of occurences of each word.
